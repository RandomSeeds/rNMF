\title{Generates files containing sequential plots of results of rNMF.}
\usage{
seq_plot(res, width = 1280, height = 720, mylayout = c(2, 5),
  force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A list, result from the 'rnmf()' function.}

\item{width}{Width of the page(s).}

\item{height}{Height of the page(s).}

\item{mylayout}{Layouts of the graphs on pages. For example mylayout = c(4,5) would put 20 graphs on each page, in 4 by 5 matrices}

\item{force}{logic. Force to produce all pages.}
}
\value{
Nothing. However files will be created.
}
\description{
This function takes the result of the 'rnmf' function (a list), and generate files containing sequential plots of reconstructed matrices with 1 and 2 basis vectors. To be more specific, let k be the number of columns of W, k >= 2. 'seq.plot' will generate 2k graphs in one or more png files. The first k images are W[,u] %*% H[u,], u = 1,..,k. The next k images are W[,(u1,u2)] %*% H[(u1,u2),], (u1,u2) = (1,2),...,(k-1,k), (k,1). The basis vectors in W are ordered by the range of values in them.

\examples{
## Load a clean single simulated tumor image.
data("Tumor")
## Add 5\% corruptions.
Tumor.corrupted = Tumor
set.seed(1)
Tumor.corrupted[sample(1:4900, round(0.05 * 4900), replace = FALSE)] = 1
## Do rnmf with different settings
res = rnmf(A = Tumor.corrupted, trim = 0.05, variation = "cell", my.seed = 1)
seq_plot(res, mylayout = c(2,5))
