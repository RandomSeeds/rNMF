\title{See vectorized or single images represented by a matrix}
\usage{
see(X, title = "Image", col = "heat", input = "multi", layout = "auto",
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numeric matrix. X is either a matrix where each column contains
the pixels of a vectorized image, or X is simply the pixel matrix of one
single image. The type of X is indicated by the argument 'input'.}

\item{title}{a charactor string. Title of the graph.}

\item{col}{a vector string. Defult = "heat". What color scheme to use?
Currently allows:
\itemize{
  \item "heat" for heat color
  \item "br" for (blue-cyan-green-yellow-red) palette
  \item "grey" for grey scale
}}

\item{input}{a charactor string. Defult = "multi". Possible values:
\itemize{
  \item "multi" if X contains multiple vectorized square images.
  \item "single" if X is the matrix of single image.
}}

\item{layout}{a vector of 2 numbers or a charactor string "auto". If layout
= "auto", multiple images will be arranged in approximatedly 9 by 16 ratio.
If layout = c(a,b), then images will be arranged in a rows and b columns.}

\item{...}{further arguments to pass to image().}
}
\value{
Null
}
\description{
The function prints multiple or single images on screen, depends
on the format of the input matrix (see details). Different color schemes can
be selected. Build-in color include greyscale, blue-red palette and heat
color.
}
\details{
If the input is a matrix of vectorized images (input = "multi",
default setting), that is, each column contains pixels of one vectorized
image, then see() restores each column into a matrix and show all images in
one frame. Current version assumes the images are squared images.

If the input is a matrix of one image (input = "single"), see() shows this
image.

## images.
