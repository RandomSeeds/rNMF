Package: rNMF
Type: Package
Title: Robust non-negative matrix factorization
Description: This package includes functions that perform robust nonnegative
    matrix factorization (rNMF). rNMF takes a nonnegative data matrix where
    rows are features and columns are observations, and decomposes it into a
    product of two low rank nonnegative matrices, while detecting and trimming
    outliers. The main function is rnmf(). The package also includes a quick
    visualization tool, see(), that arranges and shows vectorized images.
