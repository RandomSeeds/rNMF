Title: Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
Description: An implementation of robust nonnegative matrix factorization (rNMF). The rNMF algorithm decomposes a nonnegative high dimension data matrix into the product of two low rank nonnegative matrices, while detecting and trimming outliers. The main function is rnmf(). The package also includes a visualization tool, see(), that arranges and prints vectorized images.
